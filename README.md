# Project Management Helper
Created this project in order to showcase some of my capability with MVC but also as a reason to playabout with the built in Copilot Microsoft Edge uses. It was useful for prompts on gaining ideas on what to work on to showcase particular skills you ask of it but when it comes to asking it to outline a stucture of project or even with generating small code samples it struggled a bit. 

As a quick playabout this was pretty fun and managed to get a One to Many relationship working for the Project to Tasks using Enitity Framework though if I was to add to this project I'd certainly implement React or at the very least Razor or Blazor pages to make the frontend work a bit easier and more robust since just working off of raw html pages isn't really user friendly for large scale projects or even mid sized ones.

Also used this to showcase Github usage that lines up with how I've been using it in a professional environment where you create branches of the master/main that you use to implement the work you're tasked with and later merge back into master using a pull request. Although in larger departments/teams you would more likely have a develop branch and different enviroments for testing and developing that you'd use before merging into master with an official release.
